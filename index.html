  <h1>Colourblindness in a nutshell</h1>
  <h2>What is colourblindness?</h2>
  <p id="keypoint">Colourblindness is when you can't see certain colours, or distinguish between them.</p>
  <p>There are many types, the most common one is red-green colourblindness. The reason why men are more likely to be colourblind is because they only have one X chromosone, so if one carries the colourblindness trait then then will have it, but as women carry two X chromosones so even if one of the chromosones have the trait, the other will override it.</p>
  <h2>How many people are colourblind?</h2>
  <p>Approximately 1 in 12 males and 1 in 200 females are colourblind (8 and 0.5% respectively) (<a href="https://www.nei.nih.gov/learn-about-eye-health/eye-conditions-and-diseases/color-blindness">source</a>)</p>
  <h2>Are you colourblind?</h2>

  <h2>How can we be more colourblind-friendly?</h2>

    <p style="padding:16px">By creating positional cues which work with colour-based cues, it is easier to identify certain things, such as traffic lights. Here is a bad example of an inverted traffic light which may cause colourblind people to mistakenly believe it is green and perhaps even lead to an accident!<br><br>What do <u>YOU</u> think should be done about this?<br><br>Discuss with a friend and discover how you can make this junction more colourblind friendly! (hint: what do colourblind people expect the bottom light to mean when they see this?)</p>
